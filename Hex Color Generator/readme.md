# Random Hex Color Generator

This project will generate random Hex Colors and display the color on the body.

## Problem

We can easily generate RGB colors by generating random values using Math library and feeding it accordingly in the code.
But to generate Hex colors we need to take a step further. What is that?

## Learnings

We can generate random Hexadecimal values by using the radix option in 'toString()' method.

Radix - Ranges between 2 and 36. The values above 10 will get converted to alphabets.

## Use case:

We can modify this and make a color pallet generator. We can optimize the color combinations with some conditions to come up with proper color pallets.
